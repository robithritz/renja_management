# App Version & Name Update

## Changes Made

### 1. **Version Update** ✅
**File**: `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
# Before
version: 1.0.0+1

# After
version: 1.0.1+2
```

**Explanation**:
- **1.0.1** = Version name (displayed to users)
- **+2** = Build number (internal version code for Android/iOS)

### 2. **App Name Update** ✅
**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<application
    android:label="renja_management"
    ...>

<!-- After -->
<application
    android:label="Renja Management"
    ...>
```

**Explanation**:

- ✅ Build number incremented to **2** for tracking
